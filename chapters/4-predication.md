### Day 4: Toward *a* model of predication

"If semantics exists, it must say something about the meaning of predicative expressions (properties) and their nexus to subjects (predication)." -- [Chierchia 1985](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4178443)


[Generics]({{ "/chapters/4-1-generics.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})


<!-- ### Existant predication models

| Model			| Subject		| Predicate | Features |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Gradable adjectives](http://forestdb.org/models/adjectives.html) | single object | gradable adjective | infer threshold |  
| [Plural predication](http://forestdb.org/models/plural-predication.html) | plurality | gradable adjective | infer interpretation |
| [Generics](http://forestdb.org/models/generics.html) | category | property | coerce to threshold semantics |
| [Hyperbole](http://forestdb.org/models/hyperbole.html) | single object | gradable adjective | infer state and valence |
| [Metaphor](http://forestdb.org/models/metaphor.html) | single object | nominal | infer speaker goal |
| [Scalar implicature](http://forestdb.org/models/scalar-implicature.html) | ?? | property | alternative utterances |
| [Irony](http://forestdb.org/models/irony.html) | single state | property | infer valence and arousal |

#### Types of entities

- Real-world objects (*the boxes are heavy*)
- Categories (i.e., kinds) of real-world objects (*boxes are heavy*)
- States (*it's raining*)
- Events (*that was quick!*)

All of these may be either singular or plural.

#### Types of referential expressions

(from [Kehler 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118882139.ch20/summary))

- Indefinite *a*: Congress passed *a bill* today
- Indefinite *this*: Congress passed *this bill* today (you won't believe what's in it)
- Definite *the*-NP: *The bill* cuts tazes for the middle class
- Familiar *that*: Congress passed *that bill* today [spoken discourse-initially]
- Demonstratives: *That bill* was pretty bad, but *this one* is downright awful
- Pronouns: Congress finally passed *it* this afternoon
- Proper names: Congress ousted *Boehner* last week

All of these may be either singular or plural.

#### Types of predicates

- Verbs: John *ran*
- Adjectives: John is *stupid*
- Gradable adjectives: John is *tall*

Predicates may ascribe **binary properties**, **gradable properties**, participation in **events**, or **generic** information. -->
