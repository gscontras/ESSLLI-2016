### Generic language

This is a model of generic language used in Ref:tessler2016manuscript.

The model takes the generic [[K has F]] to mean the prevalence of 
property F within kind K --- i.e., P(F | K) --- is above some threshold.
This threshold --- `theta` --- is thought to be in general unknown 
(`theta = uniform(0,1)`) and must be inferred in context. 

Context here takes the form of the listener and speakers shared beliefs
about the property in question. The shape of this distribution
affects model predictions, because the threshold must be calibrated to make utterances 
truthful and informative. The shape of this distribution varies significantly 
among different properties (e.g. *lays eggs*, *carries malaria*), and may 
be the result of a deeper conceptual model of the world. For instance,
if speakers and listeners believe that some kinds have a causal mechanism that
could give rise to the property, while others do not, then we would expect
teh prior to be structured as a mixture distribution 
(Cf. Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005). 

## Prior model

The following model `structuredPriorModel` instantiates this idea.
`phi` is the potential of a property F to be present in a kind.
This can also be thought of the prevalence of the property at a 
category levels (what % of kinds have this property present within the kind?).
For example, "lays eggs" is present in ducks, swans, fish, but not kangaroos or giraffes.
"Are female" is present in almost all kinds.
"Carries malaria" is present in almost no kinds.
`gamma` is the *mean prevelence when the property is present*.
Knowing that the property is present in a kind, what % of the kind do you 
expect to have it? 
For example, about 50% of a kind "is female"; 100% has wings; malaria is a rare property within a kind.
Finally, `delta` is the concentration (conceptually, the inverse variance) of that mean.
It is high for properties that present in almost every kind in exactly the same proportion (e.g. "is female"). 
It is lower when there is more uncertainty about exactly how many within a kind are expected to have the property.
